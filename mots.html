                              <br>
                              GLOBAL ICON BTS POURS OUT THEIR HEARTS TO FANS
                              <br>
                              FINDING JOY IN LOVE AND REACHING OUT TO THE WORLD THROUGH THE LEAD SINGLE 
                              ‘Boy With Luv (Feat. Halsey)’
                              <br><br>
                              As global superstars who play stadiums and are loved by countless fans across the world, 
                              BTS now looks to shape the future reflecting on and using the power they have 
                              gained while embracing all its shadows.
                              <br><br>
                              Opening the MAP OF THE SOUL series with PERSONA, BTS talks about the joy in finding love, 
                              and reaches out to the world with the messages they want to share with their fans. 
                              The band is especially curious about the stories of each and everyone who have helped 
                              them become who they are today.
                              <br><br>
                              There are a total of seven tracks in this album, 
                              through which BTS weaves together what they genuinely felt both within themselves 
                              and the ever-widening world around them. Through RM’s solo piece ‘Intro : Persona’, 
                              BTS asks the fundamental question: ‘Who am I?’. World-leading singer Halsey takes part as 
                              featured artist in the lead single ‘Boy With Luv (Feat. Halsey)’ where BTS talks about how true 
                              strength and love come from finding joy in the little things in life and reaching out to the world.
                              <br><br>
                              The album includes ‘Mikrokosmos’ which paints the world around oneself through human 
                              interest and the collaboration with world-famous singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran, ‘Make It Right’. 
                              In ‘HOME’, BTS finds refuge from their hardships and loneliness where their fans are. 
                              ‘Jamais Vu’ is a unit song by j-hope, Jin, Jung Kook and ‘Dionysus’ is a signature BTS hip hop 
                              track blasting ad-libs and powerful beats from start to finish.</p>

                            <p style="font-size: 20px;">BTS Releases 4th Studio Album “MAP OF THE SOUL : 7”!
                              <br>
                              A heartfelt story of BTS and their search for their “real selves”
                              <br><br>
                              Unveiled last year, the MAP OF THE SOUL series contains the honest and heartfelt story of BTS 
                              and their journey of discovering their true selves. 
                              The first chapter of this story, “MAP OF THE SOUL : PERSONA”, 
                              sang about the world and the joy of love, and the discovery of the self as it is 
                              displayed to the world; “MAP OF THE SOUL : 7” now turns inward to the shadow within in a 
                              candid acknowledgement that it, too, is part of the self.
                              <br><br>
                              “MAP OF THE SOUL : 7” looks back on the past seven years of BTS since their debut as 
                              seven members of one team. The journey was not always smooth sailing, and there were 
                              special travails that they had to endure in their rise as global superstars. 
                              Now, understanding that the scars left by those hardships is a part of their real selves, 
                              BTS accepts both “the self I want to show” and the “self I want to scorn” to at last tell their 
                              own story of finding their “real and complete selves”.
                              <br><br>
                              Bridging fine art and popular art through such initiatives as the global art project CONNECT, 
                              BTS and the “Black Swan” art film featuring a modern dance interpretation of the early-release track, 
                              BTS is poised to show their latest growth as artist through “MAP OF THE SOUL : 7”.</p>
