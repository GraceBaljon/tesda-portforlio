                                <br> BIRTHDAY: December 31, 1995 (age: 26)
                                <br> Born in: Daegu, South Korea
                                <br> Height: 179 cm

                                <br><br> V comes from a family of farmers and has said that he probably would have ended up doing the same thing 
                                if he hadn’t joined BTS. He remains extremely close with his family and greatly looks up to his father.
                                <br><br>
                                One word to describe V would be: unique. 
                                His voice easily stands out from the other vocal line because of his soulful and deep tone. 
                                He loves to play around with fashion and has a great appreciation for art as well.
                                <br><br>
                                He’s well known for his outgoing personality, 
                                and it’s often joked that he can become friends with anyone that he meets. 
                                His fun and silly personality often comes out with fan engagements as well.
                                <br><br>
                                After having a close relationship with his grandmother, 
                                V has said he picked up his fashion sense from her.
                                <br>
                                Along with photography, V likes to paint in his free time.

                                V came up with the term “I purple you” which is used by 
                                BTS and ARMYs as another way to say I love and trust you.
