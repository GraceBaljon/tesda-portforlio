                                <br><br> Jungkook is the youngest BTS member, 
                                also known as their Golden Maknae because he seems to be good at basically everything. 
                                Along with his vocal and dancing skills, Jungkook is also quite athletic and artistic.

                                he was just 15 years old. Since he left home at such a young age, 
                                Jungkook often says that the other members basically raised him and had a huge 
                                impact on who he is today.
                                <br><br>
                                He’s also well known for his video productions which are released under the name of 
                                G.C.F (Golden Closet Films) and is fascinated with cameras. 
                                He loves to film the other members and edit them in his free time.
                                <br>
                                In their music video 'Life Goes On', Jungkook was one of the directors for it.
