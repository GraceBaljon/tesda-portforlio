00:00:04.116 --> 00:00:07.155
People call me a genius scientist or...

2
00:00:07.155 --> 00:00:08.711
a weirdo

3
00:00:12.233 --> 00:00:13.448
Isn't it interesting?

4
00:00:13.715 --> 00:00:17.691
Whether this will be poison
or medicine is up to me

5
00:00:19.963 --> 00:00:21.066
Should I start?

6
00:00:31.283 --> 00:00:33.128
There is no password that cannot be cracked

7
00:00:33.822 --> 00:00:35.018
For me at least

8
00:00:42.175 --> 00:00:43.183
System hacking

9
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:44.456
Complete!

10
00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.167
There are two types of music in the world

11
00:00:58.492 --> 00:00:59.659
Good music

12
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.120
and bad music

13
00:01:06.401 --> 00:01:07.355
Whichever it is

14
00:01:07.687 --> 00:01:09.222
isn't it nice to be remembered?

15
00:01:19.828 --> 00:01:20.984
If the basics are solid

16
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.478
the road will naturally open

17
00:01:26.947 --> 00:01:28.791
The road is definitely in here

18
00:01:34.142 --> 00:01:35.142
Found it

19
00:01:53.425 --> 00:01:55.275
I like pretty and shiny things

20
00:01:55.501 --> 00:01:56.482
That's why

21
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I like you

22
00:02:14.181 --> 00:02:15.431
All fates

23
00:02:15.501 --> 00:02:19.320
were determined from the day
the universe was first formed

24
00:02:23.195 --> 00:02:25.869
You can't change your destiny

25
00:02:26.722 --> 00:02:28.927
but I can help

26
00:02:34.306 --> 00:02:36.345
I don't even start if it's
not going to be perfect

27
00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.738
If I do something, I do it properly

28
00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.310
Wanna come along?

29
00:03:01.258 --> 00:03:02.352
Okay cut!

30
00:03:03.811 --> 00:03:04.811
Let's go!

31
00:03:04.922 --> 00:03:06.641
Looks good on you! Everyone looks good!

32
00:03:06.666 --> 00:03:08.159
-Well done
-Let's go home now

33
00:03:09.158 --> 00:03:10.477
Yeah, let's go, let's go

34
00:03:10.826 --> 00:03:11.826
You look awesome!

35
00:03:13.578 --> 00:03:14.578
Jin!

36
00:03:16.006 --> 00:03:17.075
JK!

37
00:03:18.044 --> 00:03:19.106
Jimin!
