                                     Friends. 
                                     RM is also a writer and producer for the band and has also put out two of his own

                                     In their early days, RM struggled a lot with his identity as a musician. 
                                     After his career as an underground rapper, he received a lot of backlash from the community for joining BTS. 
                                     Meanwhile, he received a lot of criticism from the Korean music industry that he didn’t fit the beauty

                                Despite being the oldest, Jin is one of the more easily frightened members. 
                                He can also be quite dramatic when he’s scared and it makes for a lot of great entertainment 
                                for fans on video content. He’s also one of the better cooks in the band and has a series

                                <br> Born in: Daegu, South Korea

                                <br> Weight: 59 kg 
                                <br><br> Suga is the second oldest BTS member and can often be found taking care of things for the other members.
                                <br><br>
                                He’s known for being a bit of an introvert which sometimes leads people to wrongly believe his personality 
                                is cold. When actually Suga is very caring and sensitive when you get to know him better. 
                                The other members like to joke about how he prefers to help them without anyone noticing. 
                                And when he gets really excited his silly side will shine right through.
                                <br><br>
                                He’s well known for working long hours in his studio but when he has time off he likes to 
                                sleep as much as possible. 
                                Suga has been outspoken about his struggles with mental health in hopes to help others open up too.

                <h4 style="font-size: 21px; color: black;">Suga is the second oldest BTS member and can often be found taking care of things for the other members.
                    <br><br>
                    He’s known for being a bit of an introvert which sometimes leads people to wrongly believe his personality 
                    is cold. When actually Suga is very caring and sensitive when you get to know him better. 
                    The other members like to joke about how he prefers to help them without anyone noticing. 
                    And when he gets really excited his silly side will shine right through.
                    <br><br>
                    He’s well known for working long hours in his studio but when he has time off he likes to 
                    sleep as much as possible. 
                    Suga has been outspoken about his struggles with mental health in hopes to help others open up too.

                                V came up with the term “I purple you” which is used by 
                                BTS and ARMYs as another way to say I love and trust you.

                    if he hadn’t joined BTS. He remains extremely close with his family and greatly looks up to his father.
                    <br><br>
                    One word to describe V would be: unique. 
                    His voice easily stands out from the other vocal line because of his soulful and deep tone. 
                    He loves to play around with fashion and has a great appreciation for art as well.
                    <br><br>
                    He’s well known for his outgoing personality, 
                    and it’s often joked that he can become friends with anyone that he meets. 
                    His fun and silly personality often comes out with fan engagements as well.

                                <br><br> Jungkook is the youngest BTS member, 
                                also known as their Golden Maknae because he seems to be good at basically everything. 
                                Along with his vocal and dancing skills, Jungkook is also quite athletic and artistic.
                                <br><br>
                                Initially, Jungkook left his hometown at a very young age to take part in a talent show for kids and was soon 
                                scouted by several entertainment agencies.

                                By the time the group did debut, 
                                he was just 15 years old. Since he left home at such a young age, 
                                Jungkook often says that the other members basically raised him and had a huge 
                                impact on who he is today.
                                <br><br>
                                He’s also well known for his video productions which are released under the name of 
                                G.C.F (Golden Closet Films) and is fascinated with cameras. 
                                He loves to film the other members and edit them in his free time.

                                In their music video 'Life Goes On', Jungkook was one of the directors for it.
